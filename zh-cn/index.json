This research is in its initial phase and aims to analyze the uses and abuses of history by the new right on YouTube.

The post-install.sh script installs software packages listed in its configuration, while alias.sh sets up custom aliases.\nCustomize Aliases and Installed programs (Optional): You can modify or add your own custom aliases in the src/alias.sh script to suit your workflow. Edit the CUSTOM_ALIASES array with the desired aliases, and run the alias.sh script again to update your .bash_aliases file.

We will work with the time frame from June 2013 to the year 2018, because the June demonstrations created a favorable ground for the diffusion of \u0026ldquo;liberal in economy and conservative in customs\u0026rdquo; ideas from the new right, which coincides precisely with their more active appearance in the public and digital sphere. From this, we will seek to understand how these subjects interpret, discuss, and share the past, as well as to identify the inconsistencies of the defended contents, in order to problematize their revisionist and denialist views on the dictatorship, in contrast to what is consolidated in Brazilian historiography on the subject. This study allows us to reflect on the role of the historian in the face of new media, considering its great power to reach the public, and the challenges posed by the disputes that occur in the public sphere regarding the memories of the Brazilian military dictatorship.\nFor this master\u0026rsquo;s thesis, a database of videos, comments, and metadata from YouTube videos discussing the Brazilian military dictatorship was developed. These data were safeguarded so that future researchers could use them for their research. The list of videos is available on Zotero.\nThe database data can only be accessed by request to the author, which can be done through the form.\n","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/research-projects/1733588216310-masters-thesis/","section":"研究项目","summary":"","title":"Master's Thesis Database","type":"research-projects"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/masters/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Masters","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/tags/mestrado/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mestrado","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/tags/projeto/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Projeto","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/thesis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Thesis","type":"tags"},{"content":" 在巴西 PUC Minas（米纳斯联邦天主教大学）软件分析与开发本科阶段，我完成了多个学术项目，突显了我的技术能力与团队协作经验。该阶段为软件开发奠定了坚实基础，重点涵盖编程、软件工程与项目管理，并强调通过协作模拟真实世界场景。 ","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/undergraduate-projects/","section":"本科项目","summary":"","title":"本科项目","type":"undergraduate-projects"},{"content":"这些是我在业余时间开发的一些项目。它们不一定与我的学术研究相关，但它们是我为学习新技术或解决日常生活中遇到的一些问题而开发的项目。\n","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/personal-projects/","section":"个人项目","summary":"","title":"个人项目","type":"personal-projects"},{"content":" 这是我的研究项目页面。在这里，您可以找到有关我当前和过去的研究项目的信息，包括我的硕士论文、工作论文和未来项目。 ","date":"7 December 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/research-projects/","section":"研究项目","summary":"","title":"研究项目","type":"research-projects"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/json/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"JSON","type":"tags"},{"content":"The main objective of this project is to develop a digital menu and self-service system that simplifies daily operations for businesses in the bar and restaurant sector while enhancing customer service.
