My academic journey in History, spanning both undergraduate and master’s studies, led me to the transformative fields of Digital History and Digital Humanities. These areas not only deepened my understanding of historical narratives in the digital age but also introduced me to the dynamic world of Programming, Data Science, Linux, and Open Source technologies. Since adopting Linux in 2018, I’ve embraced its philosophy of problem-solving and innovation — a mindset that continues to shape my research and professional pursuits.\nMy research focuses on the intersections of history, technology, and society, particularly in the context of Contemporary History and Republican Brazil. I specialize in exploring topics such as Digital Humanities, Right-wing movements, Military Dictatorships in Latin America, Critical internet studies, Digital media, Digital preservation, Public History, Memory Studies, and the challenges of historical narratives in the digital era.\nC.V.

We will work with the time frame from June 2013 to the year 2018, because the June demonstrations created a favorable ground for the diffusion of \u0026ldquo;liberal in economy and conservative in customs\u0026rdquo; ideas from the new right, which coincides precisely with their more active appearance in the public and digital sphere. From this, we will seek to understand how these subjects interpret, discuss, and share the past, as well as to identify the inconsistencies of the defended contents, in order to problematize their revisionist and denialist views on the dictatorship, in contrast to what is consolidated in Brazilian historiography on the subject. This study allows us to reflect on the role of the historian in the face of new media, considering its great power to reach the public, and the challenges posed by the disputes that occur in the public sphere regarding the memories of the Brazilian military dictatorship.\nUndergraduate Thesis (B.A. in History | UFJF) # The Stories They Tell: The Brazilian Military Dictatorship Through the Eyes of Three Conservative YouTube Channels\nUndergraduate Thesis (B.Ed. in History | UFJF) # Negationism of the Military Dictatorship in the Classroom: Between Memory and History\nPublications # Journals # The \u0026ldquo;New Right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube: Conservatism and Historical Denialism about the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\nNature and Culture: From Rejection to (Re)construction - with Janaína Di Lourenço Esteves\nConference proceedings # Conservatism on YouTube and the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\nSo Happy (We Never Were): The Memory of the Armed Struggle in the Brazilian Military Dictatorship from the film \u0026ldquo;We Were Never So Happy\u0026rdquo; (1984, Murilo Salles)\nMemory, History, and Cinema: Miguel Littín - The Clandestine Filmmaker in 1985 Chile\nSoftware # geraldohomero/dh-youtube-research Digital Humanities Youtube Research Database Python 0 0 Conference organization # XXXIV History Week of UFJF - Gender, race, sexuality, and class: intersectional potentialities from the historical perspective - (2018) Formatting and standardization of conference proceedings\nII Internal Meeting of UFJF History: 30 years of the Federal Constitution and the directions of democracy in Brazil - (2018) XXXIII History Week of UFJF - Brazilian artistic representations: from the Second Reign to the Vargas Era - (2017) XXXII History Week of UFJF - The Social Role of the Historian: Contemporary Challenges for Writing History - (2016) ","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"geraldo@pop-os:~$ |","summary":"ORCID | Lattes | Zotero | ResearchGate | Web of Science | Google Scholar","title":"Research","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/study/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Study","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tech","type":"tags"},{"content":"Simplify and shorten the connection between students and discounts/offers provided to them by companies across various sectors.\nFirst Semester of 2023\nTechnologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Sass, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC), UML, VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, Figma\nPreview You can find more information about the project in the GitHub Repository.

To simplify this process, I created a set of scripts that automate the post-installation setup of Pop!_OS (22.04 LTS). In this post, we will take a look at the project and show how to use it to quickly set up your system.\ngeraldohomero/post-install-pop-os Post-installation script for the Pop!_OS (22.04) distribution, based on Ubuntu. The script contains internet verification and whether wget is installed on the device. Also, install apt, flatpak and deb packages; updates repositories, performs system cleanup and add custom alias Shell 6 1 Project Overview # The project consists of several scripts that perform various tasks, such as installing software packages, configuring custom aliases, and setting up the development environment. The main scripts are:\nrun.sh: The entry point for the post-installation process. src/post-install.sh: Installs software packages and performs system cleanup. src/alias.sh: Configures custom aliases. src/devEnv.sh: Installs development tools like Node.js, .NET SDK, and Entity Framework Core. src/githubClone.sh: Clones all repositories of a specified GitHub user. src/homeScript.sh: Copies utility scripts to the home directory and makes them executable. misc/update.sh: Updates and upgrades the system. misc/syncthingStatus.sh: Checks the status of Syncthing. misc/swapAudio.sh: Switches audio output channels. LICENSE misc/ swapAudio.sh syncthingStatus.sh update.sh README.md run.sh src/ alias.sh devEnv.sh githubClone.sh homeScript.sh post-install.sh Getting Started # Step 1: Clone the Repository # First, clone the repository to your preferred location. In this example, we will clone it to the Downloads folder:\ngit clone https://github.com/geraldohomero/post-install-pop-os.git $HOME/Downloads/post-install-pop-os Step 2: Make the Scripts Executable # Navigate to the cloned repository and make the scripts executable:\ncd $HOME/Downloads/post-install-pop-os chmod +x *.sh src/*.sh misc/*.sh Step 3: Run the Post-Installation Setup Script # Run the run.sh script to start the post-installation process:\nThe script will display colorful and informative messages as it progresses through the installation and configuration steps. You may need to provide your password for certain operations that require administrative privileges.\nStep 4: Follow the On-Screen Instructions # The setup script will guide you through the installation process. It will:\nRun the src/post-install.sh script to install software packages and perform system cleanup. Run the src/alias.sh script to configure custom aliases. Copy utility scripts (update.sh, misc/syncthingStatus.sh, and misc/swapAudio.sh) to the home directory and make them executable. Run the src/devEnv.sh script to install development tools. Run the src/githubClone.sh script to clone all repositories of a specified GitHub user. Step 5: Customize Aliases and Installed Programs # You can modify or add your own custom aliases in the src/alias.sh script to suit your workflow. Edit the CUSTOM_ALIASES array with the desired aliases and run the src/alias.sh script again to update your .bash_aliases file.\nStep 6: Review Installed Software and Aliases # After the setup is complete, you can review the installed software and aliases on your system. The src/post-install.sh script installs software packages listed in its configuration, while the src/alias.sh script configures custom aliases.\nStep 7: Use Utility Scripts # The utility scripts misc/update.sh, misc/syncthingStatus.sh, and misc/swapAudio.sh are copied to your home directory and made executable. You can use them as follows:\nupdate: Updates and upgrades the system. syncstatus: Checks the status of Syncthing. swap: Switches audio output channels. Conclusion # By following these steps, you can automate the post-installation setup for Pop!_OS, saving time and ensuring a consistent environment across installations. Feel free to customize the scripts to meet your specific needs and workflow.\n","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1732885121982-post-instal-pop-os/","section":"Posts","summary":"Setting up a new operating system can be a tedious task, especially when it comes to installing essential software, configuring the environment, and setting up aliases for frequently used commands.","title":"Automating Post-Installation Setup on Pop!_OS with Custom Scripts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/automation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Automation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pop-os/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pop-Os","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scripting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scripting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/setup/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Setup","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 June 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/alternatives/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Alternatives","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is a list of the best free and open source software alternatives for security and privacy.
