We will work with the time frame from June 2013 to the year 2018, because the June demonstrations created a favorable ground for the diffusion of \u0026ldquo;liberal in economy and conservative in customs\u0026rdquo; ideas from the new right, which coincides precisely with their more active appearance in the public and digital sphere. From this, we will seek to understand how these subjects interpret, discuss, and share the past, as well as to identify the inconsistencies of the defended contents, in order to problematize their revisionist and denialist views on the dictatorship, in contrast to what is consolidated in Brazilian historiography on the subject. This study allows us to reflect on the role of the historian in the face of new media, considering its great power to reach the public, and the challenges posed by the disputes that occur in the public sphere regarding the memories of the Brazilian military dictatorship.\n  Monograph (Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s/UFJF) #  The Stories They Tell: The Brazilian Military Dictatorship Through the Eyes of Three Conservative YouTube Channels\n Monograph (Teaching Degree/UFJF) #  Denialism of the Military Dictatorship in the Classroom: Between Memory and History\n Publications #   Journals: #    The \u0026ldquo;New Right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube: Conservatism and Historical Denialism about the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\n  Nature and Culture: From Rejection to (Re)construction - with Janaína Di Lourenço Esteves\n   Conference proceedings: #    Conservatism on YouTube and the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\n  So Happy (We Never Were): The Memory of the Armed Struggle in the Brazilian Military Dictatorship from the film \u0026ldquo;We Were Never So Happy\u0026rdquo; (1984, Murilo Salles)\n  Memory, History, and Cinema: Miguel Littín - The Clandestine Filmmaker in 1985 Chile\n   Event management #   XXXIV History Week of UFJF - Gender, race, sexuality, and class: intersectional potentialities from the historical perspective - (2018)   Formatting and standardization of event conference proceedings\n  II Internal Meeting of UFJF History: 30 years of the Federal Constitution and the directions of democracy in Brazil - (2018) XXXIII History Week of UFJF - Brazilian artistic representations: from the Second Reign to the Vargas Era - (2017) XXXII History Week of UFJF - The Social Role of the Historian: Contemporary Challenges for Writing History - (2016)  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/academic/","section":"Academic","summary":"Dissertation (Master\u0026rsquo;s/UFJF) #  (De)constructing History on the Internet: Views on the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in channels of the \u0026ldquo;new right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube (2013-2018)\n Abstract: This dissertation aims to analyze videos from major channels of the Brazilian new right on YouTube that address the theme of the Brazilian military dictatorship, as well as their respective comments.","title":"Academic"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Author","summary":"","title":"Author"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" geraldo.couto@sga.pucminas.br geraldohomero@proton.me  ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/contact/","section":"Contact me","summary":" geraldo.couto@sga.pucminas.br geraldohomero@proton.me  ","title":"Contact me"},{"content":"Geraldo awesome bio.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/geraldohomero/","section":"Author","summary":"Geraldo awesome bio.","title":"Geraldo Homero"},{"content":" GitHub #   PUC-Minas - University Discount Project/Interactive Application (2023.1) #  Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Sass, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC), UML, VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, Figma\n Fuel Consumption #  Technologies: ASP.NET Core (MVC), C#, Visual Studio 2022, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EntityFramework 5.0.17, BCrypt, Microsoft SQL Server (com Data Annotations)\n PUC-Minas - Bars and Restaurants Project/Web Development (2022.2) #   Demo  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, MarvelApp, Trello e VSCode\n Best Free and Open Source (not all) Software Alternatives (for Security and Privacy) Regex Tester Shell script - Pop!_OS post-installation Shell script - Daily updates Zotero + LibreOffice Integration on Linux Iriun Webcam Error (Linux)   Websites: #   Janaína Di Lourenço | Made with Hugo and Hallo | Github Repo   Design #   Pop!_OS Wallpaper     ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"GitHub #   PUC-Minas - University Discount Project/Interactive Application (2023.1) #  Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Sass, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC), UML, VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, Figma","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
