During my undergraduate and graduate studies in History, I had the opportunity to delve into the world of Digital History, which introduced me to Linux and the open-source community. Witnessing the profound impact of technology on our lives fueled my intrigue even further.\nIn 2018, I made the complete switch to Linux, a decision I have never regretted! Through my Linux journey, I have acquired invaluable lessons, the most important being that there is no problem without a solution. In 2022, I embarked on my journey in Web Development at PUC Minas, diligently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, MySQL, C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have been actively pursuing self-study in various technologies that have piqued my interest, such as Rust, Vue.js, Docker, and Kubernetes.\nSkills # Development HTML - CSS | Bootstrap | Sass | Tailwind JavaScript | React.js | Node.js | React Native C# | .NET | ASP.NET Core | MVC SQL | MySQL | SQLServer | SQLite NoSQL | MongoDB Git | Github | Gitlab | Bitbucket AI | Llama | Gemini Python Rust Linux Shell Scripting Ubuntu Debian NixOS Arch Linux WSL Docker Design Figma Photoshop Penpot Data Microsoft Power BI GNU PSPP Google Looker Studio Education # School Link Degree Date ","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Geraldo Homero \u003e_","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always been deeply curious about technology, and over the years, my interest has blossomed into a full-fledged passion.","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/academic/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"academic","type":"tags"},{"content":" ORCID Lattes ResearchGate Google Scholar Dissertation (Master\u0026rsquo;s/UFJF) # (De)constructing History on the Internet: Views on the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in channels of the \u0026ldquo;new right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube (2013-2018)\nAbstract: This dissertation aims to analyze videos from major channels of the Brazilian new right on YouTube that address the theme of the Brazilian military dictatorship, as well as their respective comments. We will work with the time frame from June 2013 to the year 2018, because the June demonstrations created a favorable ground for the diffusion of \u0026ldquo;liberal in economy and conservative in customs\u0026rdquo; ideas from the new right, which coincides precisely with their more active appearance in the public and digital sphere. From this, we will seek to understand how these subjects interpret, discuss, and share the past, as well as to identify the inconsistencies of the defended contents, in order to problematize their revisionist and denialist views on the dictatorship, in contrast to what is consolidated in Brazilian historiography on the subject. This study allows us to reflect on the role of the historian in the face of new media, considering its great power to reach the public, and the challenges posed by the disputes that occur in the public sphere regarding the memories of the Brazilian military dictatorship.\nMonograph (Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s/UFJF) # The Stories They Tell: The Brazilian Military Dictatorship Through the Eyes of Three Conservative YouTube Channels\nMonograph (Teaching Degree/UFJF) # Denialism of the Military Dictatorship in the Classroom: Between Memory and History\nPublications # Journals: # The \u0026ldquo;New Right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube: Conservatism and Historical Denialism about the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\nNature and Culture: From Rejection to (Re)construction - with Janaína Di Lourenço Esteves\nConference proceedings: # Conservatism on YouTube and the Brazilian Military Dictatorship\nSo Happy (We Never Were): The Memory of the Armed Struggle in the Brazilian Military Dictatorship from the film \u0026ldquo;We Were Never So Happy\u0026rdquo; (1984, Murilo Salles)\nMemory, History, and Cinema: Miguel Littín - The Clandestine Filmmaker in 1985 Chile\nEvent management # XXXIV History Week of UFJF - Gender, race, sexuality, and class: intersectional potentialities from the historical perspective - (2018) Formatting and standardization of event conference proceedings\nII Internal Meeting of UFJF History: 30 years of the Federal Constitution and the directions of democracy in Brazil - (2018) XXXIII History Week of UFJF - Brazilian artistic representations: from the Second Reign to the Vargas Era - (2017) XXXII History Week of UFJF - The Social Role of the Historian: Contemporary Challenges for Writing History - (2016) ","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/academic/","section":"Geraldo Homero \u003e_","summary":"ORCID Lattes ResearchGate Google Scholar Dissertation (Master\u0026rsquo;s/UFJF) # (De)constructing History on the Internet: Views on the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in channels of the \u0026ldquo;new right\u0026rdquo; on YouTube (2013-2018)","title":"Academic","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cargo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"cargo","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pt-br/tags/pesquisa/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"pesquisa","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/projects/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"projects","type":"tags"},{"content":" WorstGameEver # geraldohomero/worst-game-ever Play along and be frustrated JavaScript 0 0 Technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, MySQL, DBeaver, Github, VSCode, REST\nPreview PUC-Minas - \u0026ldquo;Mei a Mei\u0026rdquo; Project # First Semester of 2024\nICEI-PUC-Minas-PMV-ADS/pmv-ads-2024-1-e4-proj-dad-t3-mei pmv-ads-2024-1-e4-proj-dad-t3-mei created by GitHub Classroom C# 2 2 Technologies: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, React.js, React Native, MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Compass, RESTful API, Swagger, Postman, Visual Studio 2022, VSCode, Rider, Figma, Trello, Git, Github, NUnit, XUnit\nPreview No preview yet\nPUC-Minas - TaskBook Project # Second Semester of 2023\nICEI-PUC-Minas-PMV-ADS/pmv-ads-2023-2-e3-proj-mov-t3-time2-app Aplicativo de tarefas pré determinadas e agrupadas por projeto, que possa ser usado pelos gestores e funcionários com a finalidade de gerar relatórios de tempo desprendido em cada tarefa.
